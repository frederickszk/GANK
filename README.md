ðŸŽ‰ Our paper `GANK: Dynamic Geometric and Appearance Features for Efficient and
Robust Detection of Face Forgery` has been accepted by **TOMM'25**! [[Paper Link](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3716827)]

Currently, we need additional time to organize the training code and prepare instructions and documentation. The related code will be updated in this repository soon.
The code for the prior work related to this research can be found in [LRNet](https://github.com/frederickszk/LRNet). Thank you for your attention to our work!
